### [𝐖𝐡𝐨 𝐈 𝐚𝐦]

Hello, my name is Maider 😄. I am a telecommunications engineer, as I could have been an architect, librarian or seal keeper. Since I was little, I have been curious about practically everything, although what I am most passionate about is music. 🎻

In fact I have played the cello since I was 9 years old. For this reason, I have suffered in my own flesh (well, and my parents) the transport of a heavy instrument everywhere.

I invite you to greet me by email at 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨@𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞.𝐜𝐨𝐦. Tell me you have met me here, and (if you feel like it) share your experiences with your musical instrument.
